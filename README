# Twilio Client Phonegap plugins

This is a Phonegap plugin that exposes the same JS API as Twilio Client for web, meaning you should be able to use the same Twilio Client code from your web application inside of your Phonegap application. 

To use copy the Objective-C files into the `plugins` directory of your Phonegap project, and the JavaScript file into the `www` directory.
